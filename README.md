# Fake-News-Toolbar

## Steps

1. We start testin the algoritms presents in this code using [this dataset](https://github.com/cuilimeng/CoAID). Than we saw in the confusion matrix we don't have good findings in false case. And the real/fake ratio was "10:1"
2. We try [this dataset](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/zwfdmp5syg/1/files/3063167e-1d3b-4604-a630-16016a84e8db), but also the performance metrics are not satisfactory
3. Then we combine the second dataset with the original data set of this code.
4. We add more performance metrics and we add the KNN algoritm.
